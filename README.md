# 📚 Next‑Word Predictor

A Python-based NLP project that predicts the next word given a sequence of preceding words.

## ⚙️ Features

- Tokenization, text cleaning, sequence building
- Training on large corpus splits into input sequences and next-word labels
- Supports:
  - Statistical n-gram model (e.g. bigram/trigram hashing)
  - Neural models (e.g. LSTM, GRU)
- Streamlit interface for interactive prediction

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Dependencies

- Python
- Key libraries: TensorFlow / Keras, NumPy, scikit‑learn, Pandas
- Streamlit

## 🚀 Roadmap

* Add support for transformer-based model (e.g., fine-tuned GPT)
* Integrate smoothing/back-off for n-gram model robustness
* Enhance the user interface for real-time interactive use
